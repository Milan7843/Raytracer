# Raytracer
Raytracer made in c++ / OpenGL

# How it works
Currently, the raytracer fires rays from the camera, checking where they intersect with objects.
From there, the ray is either reflected or stopped. From there, lighting is calculated.

# Plans
The new and improved lighting system will introduce area lights using emmissive materials, more realistic point lights, and indirect lighting.
These systems are still a work in progress.
